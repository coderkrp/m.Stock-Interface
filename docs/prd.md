# m.Stock Interface Brownfield Enhancement PRD

## Intro Project Analysis and Context

### Existing Project Overview

This PRD is based on the `brownfield-architecture.md` document, which was generated to analyze the existing codebase.

### Available Documentation Analysis

- Tech Stack Documentation: ✓
- Source Tree/Architecture: ✓
- Coding Standards: (Partial)
- API Documentation: ✓

### Enhancement Scope Definition

**Enhancement Type:**
- Performance/Scalability Improvements
- Other: Security Improvements

**Enhancement Description:**
The project will be refactored to act as a secure and robust bridge to the m.Stock servers. This involves implementing features to handle complexities such as login, rate-limiting, and other security enhancements, starting with rate-limiting logic. The goal is to make it easily integrable for other traders.

**Impact Assessment:**
- Moderate Impact (some existing code changes)

### Goals and Background Context

**Goals:**
- Abstract away the complexities of the m.Stock API.
- Provide a secure and reliable interface for trading.
- Enable easy integration for other developers and traders.
- Implement rate-limiting to prevent API abuse.

**Background Context:**
This enhancement is needed to transform the project from a simple API wrapper into a robust and secure bridge to the m.Stock trading platform. The current implementation lacks essential security features like rate-limiting, making it vulnerable. By adding these features and creating comprehensive documentation, the project will become a valuable tool for the m.Stock trading community, allowing other developers to easily integrate it into their own applications.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR1**: The system must implement a request throttling mechanism to ensure that calls to the m.Stock API do not exceed the API's rate limits.
- **FR2**: The system must queue incoming requests and execute them in a controlled manner, respecting the defined rate limits.
- **FR3**: The system should provide a configurable way to set the rate limits (e.g., requests per second/minute).
- **FR4**: The existing authentication functionality with the m.Stock API must remain unchanged and fully functional.
- **FR5**: The existing functionality for placing and tracking trades must remain unchanged and fully functional.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR1 (Performance)**: The request throttling mechanism should introduce minimal latency to the processing of individual requests under normal load.
- **NFR2 (Reliability)**: The system must be resilient to connection errors with the m.Stock API and should implement a retry mechanism for transient failures.
- **NFR3 (Security)**: The `APP_ADMIN_TOKEN` and other secrets must be stored securely and must not be exposed in logs or client-facing error messages.
- **NFR4 (Usability)**: The API must be clearly documented to allow for straightforward integration by other developers.
- **NFR5 (Maintainability)**: The new throttling and security logic should be implemented in a modular way to simplify future maintenance and enhancements.

### Compatibility Requirements

- **CR1 (Existing API Compatibility)**: All existing API endpoints and their request/response formats must remain backward compatible. The new throttling mechanism should not change the public contract of the API, other than potentially increasing response times as requests are queued.
- **CR2 (Data Schema Compatibility)**: The format of the `.tokens.json` file, used for the persistent token cache, must be maintained to ensure existing sessions can be loaded after an application restart.
- **CR3 (UI/UX Consistency)**: Not applicable, as this is a backend-only service.
- **CR4 (Integration Compatibility)**: The integration with the `mStock-TradingApi-A` SDK must not be broken. The application must continue to work with the currently specified version of the SDK (`0.1.1`).

## Epic and Story Structure

### Epic: Implement Request Throttling and Enhance Security

**Epic Goal**: To enhance the security and robustness of the m.Stock Interface by implementing a request throttling mechanism and preparing the codebase for future security enhancements.

#### Story 1: Establish a Testing Framework

- **As a** developer,
- **I want** to set up a `pytest` testing framework and add initial tests for the existing API endpoints,
- **so that** I can safely refactor the code and add new features without introducing regressions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. `pytest` is added to `requirements.txt`.
2. A `tests` directory is created with basic tests for the main API endpoints.
3. The tests pass successfully.

#### Story 2: Refactor for Maintainability

- **As a** developer,
- **I want** to refactor the single `interface.py` file into a more modular structure (e.g., `src/main.py`, `src/models.py`, `src/security.py`),
- **so that** the codebase is more maintainable and easier to extend.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. The application logic is split into logical modules inside a `src` directory.
2. The application runs correctly after the refactoring.
3. All tests from Story 1 continue to pass.

#### Story 3: Implement Request Throttling Middleware

- **As a** user of the API,
- **I want** the API to queue and throttle incoming requests,
- **so that** my requests are processed reliably without violating the m.Stock API's rate limits.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. A request throttling library (e.g., `slowapi`) is added to `requirements.txt`.
2. A configurable throttling middleware is implemented and applied to the application.
3. New tests are written to verify the throttling behavior.
4. All existing tests continue to pass.
