# Introduction

This document outlines the architectural approach for enhancing the **m.Stock Interface**. The enhancement focuses on refactoring the project to act as a secure and robust bridge to the m.Stock servers. This involves implementing features to handle complexities such as login, rate-limiting, and other security enhancements, starting with rate-limiting logic. Its primary goal is to serve as the guiding architectural blueprint for AI-driven development of new features while ensuring seamless integration with the existing system.

**Relationship to Existing Architecture:**
This document supplements the existing project architecture by defining how new components will integrate with current systems. Where conflicts arise between new and existing patterns, this document provides guidance on maintaining consistency while implementing enhancements.
