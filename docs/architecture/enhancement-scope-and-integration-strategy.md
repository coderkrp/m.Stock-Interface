# Enhancement Scope and Integration Strategy

### Enhancement Overview

*   **Enhancement Type:** Performance/Scalability Improvements, Security Improvements
*   **Scope:** Refactor the project to be a secure and robust bridge to the m.Stock servers, starting with rate-limiting logic.
*   **Integration Impact:** Moderate Impact

### Integration Approach

*   **Code Integration Strategy:** New logic will be implemented in a separate `security.py` module and integrated into the main application via FastAPI middleware.
*   **Database Integration:** Not applicable (stateless).
*   **API Integration:** The public API contract will remain backward compatible.
*   **UI Integration:** Not applicable.

### Compatibility Requirements

*   **Existing API Compatibility:** All existing API endpoints must remain backward compatible.
*   **Database Schema Compatibility:** The `.tokens.json` file format must be maintained.
*   **UI/UX Consistency:** Not applicable.
*   **Performance Impact:** The throttling mechanism should introduce minimal latency under normal load.
