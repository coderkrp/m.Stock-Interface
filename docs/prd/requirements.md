# Requirements

## Functional Requirements

- **FR1**: The system must implement a request throttling mechanism to ensure that calls to the m.Stock API do not exceed the API's rate limits.
- **FR2**: The system must queue incoming requests and execute them in a controlled manner, respecting the defined rate limits.
- **FR3**: The system should provide a configurable way to set the rate limits (e.g., requests per second/minute).
- **FR4**: The existing authentication functionality with the m.Stock API must remain unchanged and fully functional.
- **FR5**: The existing functionality for placing and tracking trades must remain unchanged and fully functional.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR1 (Performance)**: The request throttling mechanism should introduce minimal latency to the processing of individual requests under normal load.
- **NFR2 (Reliability)**: The system must be resilient to connection errors with the m.Stock API and should implement a retry mechanism for transient failures.
- **NFR3 (Security)**: The `APP_ADMIN_TOKEN` and other secrets must be stored securely and must not be exposed in logs or client-facing error messages.
- **NFR4 (Usability)**: The API must be clearly documented to allow for straightforward integration by other developers.
- **NFR5 (Maintainability)**: The new throttling and security logic should be implemented in a modular way to simplify future maintenance and enhancements.

## Compatibility Requirements

- **CR1 (Existing API Compatibility)**: All existing API endpoints and their request/response formats must remain backward compatible. The new throttling mechanism should not change the public contract of the API, other than potentially increasing response times as requests are queued.
- **CR2 (Data Schema Compatibility)**: The format of the `.tokens.json` file, used for the persistent token cache, must be maintained to ensure existing sessions can be loaded after an application restart.
- **CR3 (UI/UX Consistency)**: Not applicable, as this is a backend-only service.
- **CR4 (Integration Compatibility)**: The integration with the `mStock-TradingApi-A` SDK must not be broken. The application must continue to work with the currently specified version of the SDK (`0.1.1`).
