# Epic and Story Structure

## Epic: Implement Request Throttling and Enhance Security

**Epic Goal**: To enhance the security and robustness of the m.Stock Interface by implementing a request throttling mechanism and preparing the codebase for future security enhancements.

### Story 1: Establish a Testing Framework

- **As a** developer,
- **I want** to set up a `pytest` testing framework and add initial tests for the existing API endpoints,
- **so that** I can safely refactor the code and add new features without introducing regressions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. `pytest` is added to `requirements.txt`.
2. A `tests` directory is created with basic tests for the main API endpoints.
3. The tests pass successfully.

### Story 2: Refactor for Maintainability

- **As a** developer,
- **I want** to refactor the single `interface.py` file into a more modular structure (e.g., `src/main.py`, `src/models.py`, `src/security.py`),
- **so that** the codebase is more maintainable and easier to extend.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. The application logic is split into logical modules inside a `src` directory.
2. The application runs correctly after the refactoring.
3. All tests from Story 1 continue to pass.

### Story 3: Implement Request Throttling Middleware

- **As a** user of the API,
- **I want** the API to queue and throttle incoming requests,
- **so that** my requests are processed reliably without violating the m.Stock API's rate limits.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. A request throttling library (e.g., `slowapi`) is added to `requirements.txt`.
2. A configurable throttling middleware is implemented and applied to the application.
3. New tests are written to verify the throttling behavior.
4. All existing tests continue to pass.
