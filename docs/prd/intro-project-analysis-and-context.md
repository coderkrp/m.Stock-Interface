# Intro Project Analysis and Context

## Existing Project Overview

This PRD is based on the `brownfield-architecture.md` document, which was generated to analyze the existing codebase.

## Available Documentation Analysis

- Tech Stack Documentation: ✓
- Source Tree/Architecture: ✓
- Coding Standards: (Partial)
- API Documentation: ✓

## Enhancement Scope Definition

**Enhancement Type:**
- Performance/Scalability Improvements
- Other: Security Improvements

**Enhancement Description:**
The project will be refactored to act as a secure and robust bridge to the m.Stock servers. This involves implementing features to handle complexities such as login, rate-limiting, and other security enhancements, starting with rate-limiting logic. The goal is to make it easily integrable for other traders.

**Impact Assessment:**
- Moderate Impact (some existing code changes)

## Goals and Background Context

**Goals:**
- Abstract away the complexities of the m.Stock API.
- Provide a secure and reliable interface for trading.
- Enable easy integration for other developers and traders.
- Implement rate-limiting to prevent API abuse.

**Background Context:**
This enhancement is needed to transform the project from a simple API wrapper into a robust and secure bridge to the m.Stock trading platform. The current implementation lacks essential security features like rate-limiting, making it vulnerable. By adding these features and creating comprehensive documentation, the project will become a valuable tool for the m.Stock trading community, allowing other developers to easily integrate it into their own applications.
