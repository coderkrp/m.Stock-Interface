# Test Design: Story 1.3

Date: 2025-09-03
Designer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Test Strategy Overview

- Total test scenarios: 5
- Unit tests: 1 (20%)
- Integration tests: 4 (80%)
- E2E tests: 0 (0%)
- Priority distribution: P0: 2, P1: 3, P2: 0, P3: 0

## Test Scenarios by Acceptance Criteria

### AC2: A configurable throttling and timing middleware is implemented

| ID | Level | Priority | Test | Justification | Mitigates Risks |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1.3-UNIT-001 | Unit | P1 | Verify the rate limit string (e.g., "10/minute") is correctly parsed by the middleware's configuration logic. | This is pure validation logic that can be tested in isolation. | TECH-001 |
| 1.3-INT-002 | Integration | P1 | Send a single request to a protected endpoint and verify it receives a successful (200 OK) response. | Tests the basic "happy path" for the middleware, ensuring it doesn't block valid requests. | TECH-001 |

### AC3: The execution time for each request is logged

| ID | Level | Priority | Test | Justification | Mitigates Risks |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1.3-INT-003 | Integration | P1 | Make a request and capture `stdout`/`stderr` to verify that a log message containing the request's execution time is present. | Confirms the interaction between the middleware and the logging system. | PERF-001 |

### AC4: New tests are written to verify the throttling behavior

| ID | Level | Priority | Test | Justification | Mitigates Risks |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1.3-INT-001 | Integration | P0 | Send a burst of requests exceeding the configured rate limit and verify that the excess requests receive a 429 "Too Many Requests" status code. | This is the most critical test to ensure the core security and reliability function of the middleware works as expected. | SEC-001, TECH-001, TECH-003 |

### AC6: All existing tests continue to pass

| ID | Level | Priority | Test | Justification | Mitigates Risks |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1.3-REG-001 | Integration | P0 | Run the entire existing `pytest` suite after the middleware is applied. | This is a critical regression test to ensure the new middleware does not break any existing functionality. | TECH-002 |

## Risk Coverage

- **SEC-001 (Throttling Bypass)**: Covered by `1.3-INT-001`.
- **TECH-001 (Incorrect Middleware Logic)**: Covered by `1.3-UNIT-001`, `1.3-INT-001`, `1.3-INT-002`.
- **PERF-001 (Middleware Performance Overhead)**: Partially covered by `1.3-INT-003` which ensures timing is logged. Manual analysis of logs is required to assess overhead.
- **TECH-003 (Inadequate Test Coverage)**: Mitigated by the existence of this test design and its scenarios.
- **TECH-002 (Dependency Conflict)**: Covered by `1.3-REG-001`.

## Recommended Execution Order

1.  P0 Integration tests (`1.3-INT-001`, `1.3-REG-001`)
2.  P1 Unit test (`1.3-UNIT-001`)
3.  P1 Integration tests (`1.3-INT-002`, `1.3-INT-003`)
