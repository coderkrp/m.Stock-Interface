# Risk Profile: Story 1.3

Date: 2025-09-03
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 5
- Critical Risks: 0
- High Risks: 1
- Risk Score: 73/100

## High Risks Requiring Attention

### 1. [SEC-001]: Throttling Bypass
**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - The effectiveness of the rate limit depends entirely on the implementation quality. Flaws could be overlooked.
**Impact**: High - A bypass vulnerability would defeat the primary purpose of the story, potentially exposing the service to denial-of-service or rate limit violations with the underlying m.Stock API.
**Mitigation**:
- Implement comprehensive tests specifically designed to try and circumvent the throttle (e.g., using different headers, concurrent requests).
- Conduct a focused code review of the `src/security.py` module.
**Testing Focus**: Create integration tests that send bursts of requests to protected endpoints and assert that the correct number are rejected with a 429 status code.

## Risk Distribution

### By Category

- Security: 1 risk (0 critical)
- Performance: 1 risk (0 critical)

### By Component
- `src/security.py`: 3 risks
- `src/main.py`: 1 risk
- `tests/test_main.py`: 1 risk

## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID  | Description                    | Probability | Impact     | Score | Priority |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| SEC-001  | Throttling Bypass              | Medium (2)  | High (3)   | 6     | High     |
| TECH-001 | Incorrect Middleware Logic     | Medium (2)  | Medium (2) | 4     | Medium   |
| PERF-001 | Middleware Performance Overhead| Medium (2)  | Medium (2) | 4     | Medium   |
| TECH-003 | Inadequate Test Coverage       | Medium (2)  | Medium (2) | 4     | Medium   |
| TECH-002 | Dependency Conflict            | Low (1)     | Medium (2) | 2     | Low      |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: High Risk Tests
- **SEC-001 (Throttling Bypass)**:
  - Test Scenario: Send a rapid burst of N+5 requests to an endpoint limited to N requests per minute.
  - Expected Result: Verify that the first N requests are processed and the subsequent 5 receive a 429 "Too Many Requests" response.
  - Test Type: Integration Test.

### Priority 2: Medium Risk Tests
- **TECH-001, PERF-001, TECH-003**:
  - Test Scenario: Measure the execution time of a request with and without the middleware enabled to quantify overhead.
  - Test Scenario: Create unit tests for the core timing and throttling logic within the middleware.
  - Test Scenario: Verify that non-throttled requests are processed correctly and their timing is logged.

### Priority 3: Low Risk Tests
- **TECH-002 (Dependency Conflict)**:
  - Run the full regression suite after adding `slowapi` to `requirements.txt`.

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production
- The `SEC-001` risk must be mitigated with targeted testing and code review.

### Can Deploy with Mitigation
- Medium risks can be deployed if performance overhead is measured and deemed acceptable, and test coverage is adequate.

## Monitoring Requirements
- Post-deployment, monitor the average and p95 request latency to ensure the middleware is not causing performance degradation.
- Monitor application logs for the volume of 429 responses to understand throttling activity.
