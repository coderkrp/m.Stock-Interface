# Risk Profile: Story 1.1

Date: 2025-09-02
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 5
- Critical Risks: 0
- High Risks: 2
- Risk Score: 66/100

## High Risks Requiring Attention

### 1. TECH-001: Incomplete Test Coverage

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: High - It is very likely that the initial set of tests will not cover all execution paths and edge cases of the existing API.
**Impact**: Medium - Undetected bugs could persist in the codebase, and future refactoring could introduce regressions in untested areas.
**Mitigation**:
- Implement code coverage monitoring (e.g., `pytest-cov`) and set a target coverage threshold.
- Conduct thorough code reviews of the tests to identify gaps in coverage.
- **Testing Focus**: Focus on testing all API endpoints, including different HTTP methods, valid and invalid inputs, and error conditions.

### 2. TECH-002: Incorrect Test Implementation

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - There is a moderate chance that tests may be implemented incorrectly, for example, by making wrong assertions or not properly isolating the test environment.
**Impact**: High - Flawed tests can create a false sense of security, leading to bugs being missed and shipped to production.
**Mitigation**:
- Adhere to `pytest` best practices and established testing patterns.
- Ensure assertions are specific and meaningful.
- Have a second developer review the test code.
- **Testing Focus**: Manually verify that tests fail when they are expected to.

## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID | Description | Probability | Impact | Score | Priority | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| TECH-001 | Incomplete Test Coverage | High (3) | Medium (2) | 6 | High | Implement code coverage monitoring and conduct peer reviews of tests. |
| TECH-002 | Incorrect Test Implementation | Medium (2) | High (3) | 6 | High | Follow `pytest` best practices and have tests peer-reviewed. |
| TECH-003 | Flaky Tests | Medium (2) | Medium (2) | 4 | Medium | Isolate tests from external dependencies using mocks and avoid fixed timeouts. |
| OPS-001 | CI/CD Integration Issues | Low (1) | Medium (2) | 2 | Low | Ensure tests can be run via a simple command and use a standard CI/CD configuration. |
| TECH-004 | Dependency Conflicts | Low (1) | Medium (2) | 2 | Low | Use a virtual environment and pin dependencies. |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: High Risk Tests

- Write tests that cover both the "happy path" and error conditions for each API endpoint.
- Use parameterization to test a wide range of inputs.
- Review test code to ensure correctness.

### Priority 2: Medium Risk Tests

- Design tests to be deterministic and repeatable.
- Isolate tests from external services.

### Priority 3: Low Risk Tests

- Ensure the test suite can be easily executed by developers and in CI/CD pipelines.

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- All high-risk items should have their mitigation strategies implemented.

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- Medium and low risks can be accepted if their mitigations are in place.

## Monitoring Requirements

- Monitor code coverage reports to ensure coverage does not decrease over time.
- Monitor test failure rates in CI/CD to identify and address flaky tests.
