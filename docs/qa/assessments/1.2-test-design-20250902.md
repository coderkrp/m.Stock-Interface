# Test Design: Story 1.2

Date: 2025-09-02
Designer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Test Strategy Overview

- Total test scenarios: 5
- Unit tests: 0 (0%)
- Integration tests: 5 (100%)
- E2E tests: 0 (0%)
- Priority distribution: P0: 3, P1: 2, P2: 0, P3: 0

## Test Scenarios by Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: The application logic is split into logical modules inside a `src` directory.

#### Scenarios

| ID | Level | Priority | Test | Justification | Mitigates Risks |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1.2-INT-001 | Integration | P1 | Verify `src` directory and `main.py`, `models.py`, `settings.py`, `security.py` exist. | Confirms the new modular structure. | TECH-001 |

### AC2: The application runs correctly after the refactoring.

#### Scenarios

| ID | Level | Priority | Test | Justification | Mitigates Risks |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1.2-INT-002 | Integration | P0 | Start the FastAPI application and verify it listens on the expected port. | Ensures basic application startup. | TECH-001 |
| 1.2-INT-003 | Integration | P0 | Make a request to `/healthz` endpoint and verify a successful response. | Confirms basic API functionality after refactoring. | TECH-001 |

### AC3: All tests from Story 1 continue to pass.

#### Scenarios

| ID | Level | Priority | Test | Justification | Mitigates Risks |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1.2-REG-001 | Integration | P0 | Run the entire existing `pytest` suite from Story 1 and verify all tests pass. | Critical regression test for refactoring. | TECH-001, TECH-002 |
| 1.2-REG-002 | Integration | P1 | Verify that `test_interface.py` (or its renamed equivalent) correctly imports and interacts with the new `src` modules. | Ensures test suite adapts to new structure. | TECH-002 |

## Risk Coverage

- **TECH-001 (Refactoring Complexity)**: Covered by 1.2-INT-001, 1.2-INT-002, 1.2-INT-003, 1.2-REG-001.
- **TECH-002 (Test Adaptation Failure)**: Covered by 1.2-REG-001, 1.2-REG-002.

## Recommended Execution Order

1. P0 Integration tests (1.2-INT-002, 1.2-INT-003, 1.2-REG-001)
2. P1 Integration tests (1.2-INT-001, 1.2-REG-002)
