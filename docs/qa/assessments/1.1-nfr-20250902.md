# NFR Assessment: 1.1

Date: 2025-09-02
Reviewer: Quinn

## Summary

- Security: CONCERNS - Default admin token and rate limiting not addressed in this story.
- Performance: PASS - No performance regressions.
- Reliability: CONCERNS - Broad exception handling remains.
- Maintainability: PASS - Significant improvements in test coverage and code readability.

## Critical Issues

1.  **Default APP_ADMIN_TOKEN** (Security)
    *   Risk: Potential for unauthorized access if not changed in production.
    *   Fix: Ensure `APP_ADMIN_TOKEN` is securely managed in production environments. (Configuration/Deployment concern)

2.  **Broad Exception Handling** (Reliability)
    *   Risk: Can mask underlying issues and make debugging difficult.
    *   Fix: Implement more specific exception handling in `interface.py`.

## Quick Wins

- Address `DeprecationWarning` for `@app.on_event("startup")` by using `lifespan` event handlers.
- Address `DeprecationWarning` for `datetime.datetime.utcnow()` by using `datetime.datetime.now(datetime.UTC)`.
- Consider adding unit tests for `TokenCache` methods and `JsonFormatter`.
