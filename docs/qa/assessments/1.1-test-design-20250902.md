Date: 2025-09-02
Designer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Test Strategy Overview

- Total test scenarios: 18
- Unit tests: 1 (6%)
- Integration tests: 17 (94%)
- E2E tests: 0 (0%)
- Priority distribution: P0: 3, P1: 15, P2: 0

## Test Scenarios by Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: `pytest` is added to `requirements.txt`.

| ID | Level | Priority | Test | Justification |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1.1-INT-001 | Integration | P0 | Verify that `pytest` is listed as a dependency in `requirements.txt`. | Foundational step for the testing setup. It's an integration point with the project's dependency management. |

### AC2: A `tests` directory is created with basic tests for the main API endpoints.

| ID | Level | Priority | Test | Justification |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1.1-UNIT-001 | Unit | P1 | Write a simple "dummy" test function (e.g., `assert 1 == 1`) in `tests/test_interface.py`. | A unit test is the smallest, fastest way to confirm the test framework is discovering and running tests correctly. |

### AC3: The tests pass successfully.

| ID | Level | Priority | Test | Justification |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1.1-INT-003 | Integration | P0 | Execute the full test suite using `python -m pytest` and verify that the command exits with a status code of 0 (success). | This integrates all the previous steps and confirms the end-to-end success of the story's goal. |

### AC4: Basic tests are written for all API endpoints.

| ID | Level | Priority | Test | Justification |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1.1-INT-004 | Integration | P1 | Test `POST /auth/login` with a mock to ensure it returns a success or auth error without crashing. | Basic smoke test for the login endpoint. |
| 1.1-INT-005 | Integration | P1 | Test `POST /auth/session` with mock data. | Basic smoke test for the session endpoint. |
| 1.1-INT-006 | Integration | P1 | Test `POST /orders` (Place Order) with mock data. | Basic smoke test for placing an order. |
| 1.1-INT-007 | Integration | P1 | Test `POST /orders/modify` with mock data. | Basic smoke test for modifying an order. |
| 1.1-INT-008 | Integration | P1 | Test `POST /orders/cancel` with mock data. | Basic smoke test for canceling an order. |
| 1.1-INT-009 | Integration | P1 | Test `GET /orders` (Orderbook). | Basic smoke test for the orderbook endpoint. |
| 1.1-INT-010 | Integration | P1 | Test `POST /orders/status` with mock data. | Basic smoke test for the order status endpoint. |
| 1.1-INT-011 | Integration | P1 | Test `GET /trades` (Tradebook). | Basic smoke test for the tradebook endpoint. |
| 1.1-INT-012 | Integration | P1 | Test `POST /market/ltp` with mock data. | Basic smoke test for the LTP endpoint. |
| 1.1-INT-013 | Integration | P1 | Test `POST /market/ohlc` with mock data. | Basic smoke test for the OHLC endpoint. |
| 1.1-INT-014 | Integration | P1 | Test `POST /market/historical` with mock data. | Basic smoke test for the historical data endpoint. |
| 1.1-INT-015 | Integration | P1 | Test `GET /market/instruments`. | Basic smoke test for the instruments endpoint. |
| 1.1-INT-016 | Integration | P1 | Test `POST /market/loser_gainer` with mock data. | Basic smoke test for the loser/gainer endpoint. |
| 1.1-INT-017 | Integration | P1 | Test `GET /healthz`. | Basic smoke test for the health check endpoint. |

## Risk Coverage

| Risk ID | Mitigating Test IDs |
|---|---|
| TECH-001 | 1.1-INT-004 through 1.1-INT-017 |
| TECH-002 | 1.1-INT-003 |
| TECH-003 | 1.1-INT-003 |
| TECH-004 | 1.1-INT-001 |

## Recommended Execution Order

1. P0 Integration tests (1.1-INT-001, 1.1-INT-003)
2. P1 Unit tests (1.1-UNIT-001)
3. P1 Integration tests (1.1-INT-004 through 1.1-INT-017)
