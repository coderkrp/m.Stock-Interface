Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 4
- Critical Risks: 0
- High Risks: 0
- Risk Score: 90/100 (calculated)

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

None identified.

## Risk Distribution

### By Category

- Technical: 2 risks (0 critical)
- Operational: 1 risk (0 critical)
- Performance: 1 risk (0 critical)

### By Component

- `interface.py`: 2 risks
- `src` modules: 2 risks
- `tests`: 1 risk
- Deployment: 1 risk

## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID | Description | Probability | Impact | Score | Priority |
| :------ | :---------- | :---------- | :----- | :---- | :------- |
| TECH-001 | Refactoring Complexity | Medium (2) | Medium (2) | 4 | Medium |
| TECH-002 | Test Adaptation Failure | Medium (2) | Medium (2) | 4 | Medium |
| OPS-001 | Deployment Issues | Low (1) | Medium (2) | 2 | Low |
| PERF-001 | Performance Degradation (Minor) | Low (1) | Low (1) | 1 | Minimal |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

None.

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

None.

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- **TECH-001 (Refactoring Complexity)**: Extensive unit and integration testing of all refactored modules. Thorough code reviews. Regression testing to ensure no new bugs are introduced.
- **TECH-002 (Test Adaptation Failure)**: Careful adaptation of existing tests to the new structure. Frequent execution of all tests. Manual smoke testing of core functionalities.
- **OPS-001 (Deployment Issues)**: Deployment testing in a non-production environment. Review and update CI/CD pipelines.
- **PERF-001 (Performance Degradation)**: Basic performance sanity checks (e.g., startup time, simple request latency).

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

None.

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- All identified Medium and Low risks with the proposed mitigation strategies.

### Accepted Risks

None.

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- Application logs for any unexpected errors or warnings related to refactoring.
- Basic performance metrics (e.g., response times) to detect any unexpected degradation.

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile if:

- Significant changes are made to the refactoring approach.
- New dependencies are introduced.
- Unexpected issues arise during development or testing.
